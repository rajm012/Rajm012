## 👋 The TL;DR About Me

I'm a builder who thinks in equations and ships in code. My GitHub is a lab notebook of what happens when you mix a math degree with too much curiosity and songs. 

**Current Obsessions:** Making AI work locally (not in some distant cloud), and figuring out if neural networks can actually make differential equations less painful, and as side quests making some webs to just go with flow.

**Reality Check:** Have obsession with what I do, currently working on a digital twin or Personalized Agentic Helper. I've built everything from AI website generators to Web security or exploitation tools.

## 🎯 What I'm Building Right Now

### 🔐 **Digital Twin**
- An agent to take off all your works and work locally (Who wanna share their personal embarrassments  online?)


### 🧠 **Math + AI Experiments**
- **PINNs for Differential Equations** - Making Bessel's equations slightly less terrifying with neural networks
- **Traffic Flow Prediction** - Applying PDEs and LSTMs to understand why Indian traffic feels uniquely chaotic
- **Financial Modeling with Neural Networks** - Because if math can't beat the market, what can?

### 🛠️ **Practical Tools I Actually Use**
- **GenWeb** - AI website builder for when I need a landing page fast
- **Browser Extensions** - Dark mode everywhere, smart note-taking, and motivational quotes when I'm procrastinating
- **SubtitleAI-Pro** - To get subtitle for some Malayalam, Odia movies

---

### 🔬 Research Interests
- **Computational Complexity:** What *can't* we compute efficiently, and why?
- **AI for Mathematical Modeling:** When do neural networks actually help vs. just adding complexity?
- **Applied Cryptography:** Building things that stay secure in the real world

---

## 🎯 My Development Philosophy

### 1. **Solve Your Own Problems First**
I built a password manager because I kept forgetting passwords. I built a file encryption tool because I didn't trust cloud services. The best tools come from personal pain points.

### 2. **Privacy Matters**
Local AI (Ollama), browser-based object detection, local-first architecture. Your data shouldn't have to leave your device for basic functionality.

### 3. **Math Should Be Practical**
Differential equations can model traffic flow. Linear programming can optimize resources. Graph theory can secure networks. Abstract math becomes beautiful when it solves real problems.

### 4. **Learn in Public**
My GitHub is messy, my commit messages are sometimes "fixed that thing," and my early projects are embarrassing. That's how learning works.

## 💭 Behind the Code

**When I'm not coding:**
- Explaining why your password "password123" is a bad idea to anyone who will listen
- Learning why it's hard to break some crypto systems
- Exploring why science focus on **How it works?** instead of **Why it works?**
- Playing with 3D graphics and making things spin for no reason
- Discovering Cinemas and Streams

**My ideal project has:**
1. A mathematical core to nerd out on
2. Real human impact (accessibility, privacy, education)
3. Technical challenges that make me learn something fundamentally new
4. Good songs to vibe on

## 📬 Let's Connect & Collaborate

I'm actively looking for **Summer 2026 internships** where I can work on:
- AI/ML with mathematical foundations
- Full-stack development with real impact
- Pure Research or Engineering
- Anything that makes me say "wait, how does that work?" daily

## 🎯 Quick Checks

```yaml
FavoriteError: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '...' of undefined"
CurrentMood: "Building something that will probably break in production"
```

**P.S.** If you're a recruiter, yes, I'm looking for internships. No, I won't ask you to solve FizzBuzz in an interview (unless you want to). Let's talk about hard problems instead.

**P.P.S.** Most of these projects have typos in the READMEs. I'm better at code than spelling.
